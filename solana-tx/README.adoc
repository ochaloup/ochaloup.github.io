== To build and develop

[source,sh]

[NOTE]
====
The build was failing with ExplorerKit error of 

[source]
----
ERROR in ./node_modules/.pnpm/@solanafm+utils@0.3.0/node_modules/@solanafm/utils/dist/index.mjs 1:9663-9705
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'dayjs/plugin/relativeTime' in 'solana-tx/node_modules/.pnpm/@solanafm+utils@0.3.0/node_modules/@solanafm/utils/dist'
Did you mean 'relativeTime.js'?
BREAKING CHANGE: The request 'dayjs/plugin/relativeTime' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
(probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
Add the extension to the request.
resolve 'dayjs/plugin/relativeTime' in 'solana-tx/node_modules/.pnpm/@solanafm+utils@0.3.0/node_modules/@solanafm/utils/dist'
  Parsed request is a module

Which I have no much mood to investigate about. I just add a `pnpm _hack` to copy files and moving on.
